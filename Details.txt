  Revision for learning react:
    var, let, const
    arrow function
    template literals
    spread, rest
    array & object destructures
    property shorthand

  promise:
    async / await
    error handling
      try {
        // code which prone to errors
      } catch ( e ) { 
        // catch the error which happend during the execution of above code
      }
  fetch:
    GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
  
  Node Application: ( React will be running based on Node Application )
    node --> separate runtime platform for Javascript like browser

    Download NodeJs:
      https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer

    Extensions:
      ESLint

  npm - Node Package Manager

    JavaScript Libraries:
      Node Project: Node is Isolated Environment to RUN JS Files
        npm --> Node Package/Libraries Manager 
        inlcudes open source libraries into a Node Project

    npm project ( a simple code setup which allows installation of external packages )
    Creation of npm project:
      1. create needed folder
      2. change directory to created folder
      3. npm init -> cmd to create npm project

    
      npm install <package-name>

      **can be done only in the folder where package.json is there** 

      import the package and use it with require( old syntax )/import

    package.json --> information about npm project
      name, description, version, main, author, license

      scripts --> run an operation related to the project
    package-lock.json --> file which keeps track of the packages installed and their dependencies

    node_modules --> js file & function used by the project ( should not be pushed to github )

      Eg: lodash --> utility functions for js

    readme.md --> used for documenting Your repository codebase

Task:
  Read about Single Page & Multi Page Applications

  Incase if You do not have nodejs please download it and install
  Also install the extensions required ( whatever the extensions your comformtable and familiar )
